        <h3>What is technology?</h3>
        <p>In this day and age, <em>technology</em> plays a significant role in an individual’s daily life. But what exactly is technology? Technology is the product of innovation and inventions born from society’s application of technical knowledge. Technology was developed through scientific wisdom and understanding to create solutions that change the way society navigates and handles the complexities of life.</p>
        
        <h3>Technology’s impact on Society</h3>
        <p>Due to its rapid growth and proliferation, more opportunities have appeared for people in society. Technology’s impact changes the way people approach different challenges in their life; from the way they think and to the way they speak and communicate. Here are some examples on the impact of technology toward society:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Improved Communication</strong>: Technology has revolutionized communication. Connecting with other people has never been so much easier, allowing anybody to communicate with other people around the world. Social media platforms and messaging applications have allowed anybody to get in touch with friends, family, and colleagues regardless of the geographical distance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Access to Information</strong>: Education and learning enhancements have also been achieved through technology. In this current generation, through the internet, data and information on the internet is mostly free of charge. The resources on the internet allow people to easily expand and enhance their knowledge.</p>

        <p><strong>Medical Advancements</strong>: In the medical field, technology helped doctors and scientists create and develop treatments that transformed healthcare overall. With the help of advanced tools and innovative research material, the healthcare industry has been able to create drugs that could cure diseases that were once deemed incurable. With the help of technology, the potential of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals could reach limits that society once thought were impossible.</p>

        <p><strong>Various entertainment activities</strong>: Technology has also revolutionized the way society experiences entertainment.  In today’s generation, video games have evolved significantly from 2D games of the past to immersive and interactive 3D environments for people to enjoy. Another contribution to entertainment from technology are video streaming platforms. These platforms offer a wide array of content from movies, shows, and digital content for people to enjoy anytime, anywhere.</p>
        
        <h3>Negative Impact of Technology on Society</h3>

        <p>Even though technology has its perks and improved the daily life of an individual’s lifestyle. It also has its downsides and impacts many people in negative ways. Here are some examples on the negative impacts of technology:</p>

        <p>Increase of unemployment in society: Technology has taken the livelihood of many individuals because of their low cost and efficiency, large and small businesses now prioritize technology because of its ease to achieve and complete specific tasks for the companies’ necessities.</p>

        <p>Technological addiction: An individual could get overly immersed in the world of technology. The excessive use can strain social relationships, as people will pursue screen time over face-to-face interactions with loved ones.</p>

        <h3>Social Issues</h3>

        <p>Paths were also paved by technology for people to create more social issues. Here are some examples of the social issues that people face when using the internet:</p>

        <p><strong>Identity Theft</strong>: This is to utilize the identity or financial information of another person to commit malicious intentions.</p>

        <p><strong>Cybercrime</strong>1: a wide range of illegal activities that include phishing, hacking, catfishing, and online scams. These crimes affect individuals and even businesses that could cause substantial harm.</p>

        <p><strong>Health</strong>: Excessive use of the internet also lays an impact on health and fitness. This may impact eyesight, backbone, weight, etc.</p>

        <p><strong>Cyberbullying</strong>: Social media have made it easier for people to criticize or bully an individual or company. This could be done by sending hateful messages, spreading rumors, or launching attacks, etc.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Culture has also been changed and shaped profoundly from the influence of technology. It doesn’t only affect individual countries, but across the entire globe. Society has been influenced from the way people share their ideas and how people communicate, displaying that society has come a long way. Additionally, people use their devices to now interact and spend time with their closest friends and loved ones, even when they are physically apart. Individuals also use technology to form their opinion and evaluate their judgment towards a specific person.</p>

        <p>For many, technology and the internet is the primary focus on how individuals see the world. While technology has the greatest benefits, it also separates people from reality. The rapid growth of reliance on technology has led to a decline in communication skills, making it difficult for people to tackle real-life problems and scenarios. As technology continues to evolve, it is vital that individuals should utilize the digital world for their benefits without losing touch with the necessary human experiences of life.</p>
