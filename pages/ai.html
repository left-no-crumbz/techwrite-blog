        <p>Have you ever caught yourself following the latest trend or purchasing something simply because a famous figure on social media made it seem irresistible? Or maybe you’ve felt the urge to reshape parts of yourself to align with the expectations set by the masses? As humans, we are inherently social creatures, and our need for connection often pulls us into trends. Engaging with these trends allows us to interact with others and feel like we're part of the larger social system. This forces human nature to achieve acceptance by following the interests of the masses.</p>

        <p>However, some of these trends are short-lived and expensive. Think about the times you and your friends have shared videos with each other on social media, whether it's dancing clips or funny trends that you planned to recreate. Or consider how many items you’ve added to your cart on TikTok, influenced by live reviews and attractive shipping deals.</p>



        <h3>The Balance Between Trends and Reality</h3>
        <p>Many people fear missing out on important events, especially when others seem to be having fun. In today’s world, popularity often depends on doing something funny or following the latest trends that capture public attention. However, not everyone feels the need to join in. Some are content with their lives as they are. But ignoring certain things can sometimes lead to being out of touch with the world and people around them. While following trends can be enjoyable, it’s crucial to remember the line between social media trends and what truly matters in real life. Finding balance is key.</p>

        <h3>Online Shopping and Self-Control</h3>
        
        <p>Online shopping has soared in popularity since the pandemic began. It’s become much more convenient to buy items from the comfort of our homes rather than venturing out. The appeal of deals and discounts has further boosted consumer interest. Over time, live selling on various platforms has become a common practice, making it easier to purchase products with just a few taps.</p>

        <p>This behavior can disrupt our ability to make thoughtful online purchases. Buyer’s remorse is a common feeling of disappointment and regret that occurs when an item doesn’t meet expectations or feels unnecessary (Cruze, 2022). Exercising self-control is important, as money spent on unneeded items could be better saved for essential things we truly need.</p>

        <h3>Short attention span</h3>

        <p>Over the years, research has shown that technology has significantly affected people's attention spans. For example, TikTok is a major factor because its videos are only 5 to 15 seconds long, encouraging users to quickly scroll to the next one. This can create an addictive-like behavior where our brains crave short bursts of entertainment. As a result, it becomes harder for us to focus on longer tasks or activities, leading to a decreased ability to concentrate and complete more involved tasks (Zaveri, 2023).</p>
        <p>The study concluded that “More choice means less patience.” Humans increasingly seek media that delivers instant gratification, leading to a decline in attention spans. This creates an entertaining trap where our ability to focus is at risk.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In the digital times of today, trends and technologies can so easily blind one from being aware of anything going on around them. Engagement with digital trends may be an avenue of connectedness and excitement; however, a variety of challenges, including uncontrollable spending impulses, pressure to conformity, and short spans of attention, come as part of the deal. What is needed is a balancing act: one that embraces digital convenience but at the same time remains relevant to priorities in the real world. Conscious of these influences, mindful consumption will afford us the benefits of technology without losing track of the things that truly add value to our lives.</p>
