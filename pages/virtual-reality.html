        <p>Welcome to the fascinating world of Virtual and Augmented Reality! These emerging technologies are changing how we engage with the digital world, further connecting reality to a virtual space.</p>
        <p>Virtual reality (VR) immerses us in a completely simulated environment where we can explore scenarios such as historical events, foreign lands, or even fantasy worlds.</p>
        <p>Augment reality or AR, on the other hand, aims to combine the digital world with the real world by incorporating digital information into reality.</p>
        <p>Though both realities are made to create a simulated experience for us, they each have unique concepts and different applications. Let’s find out more as we dig deeper into VR and AR.</p>
        <h3>What is Virtual Reality?</h3>
        <p>As mentioned, virtual reality is where we are immersed in a completely simulated environment, detached from reality. It normally utilizes our senses to create a more immersive experience, which is done through software and hardware components. To achieve the ideal environment, these are some of the key features needed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immersion</strong> - By simulating a computer-generated world that may mimic reality, we should feel like they are actually in this ‘world’. With the help of gears, such as headsets, controllers, data gloves, etc., we can fully immerse ourselves in the virtual world.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction</strong> - VR should be interactive as we interact with various elements inside the virtual world. These elements of interaction may include manipulating objects, exploring the vast virtual world, communicating with other characters, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensory stimulation</strong> - To create an immersive and interactive VR, it should also make use of our senses (sight, touch, hearing, etc.). By displaying realistic visuals, VR creates a life-like environment that allows us to believe that this is real. Apart from that, VR also offers spatial audio in which sound effects are positioned depending on our environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Real-life Application of VR</h3>

        <p>Virtual Reality has been closely related to the gaming industry in the past decades as products, like Beat Saber, Blade & Sorcery, etc., have garnered attention from users around the globe. Though the gaming industry has been at the forefront of VR developments, there are many applications of VR in various fields, which include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education</strong> - VR introduces new ways of learning and teaching techniques. Students can engage and access environments that are normally inaccessible in the real world.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare</strong> - VR can help patients deal with anorexia, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore,  doctors might be able to use VR for diagnoses and treatment options.</li>
            <li><strong>Entertainment</strong> - VR has not only affected the gaming industry but also the film and television industry. It can provide us with an immersive experience where they can feel as if they are part of the movie/scene.</li>
            <li><strong>Training</strong> - VR can create a simulated real-world scenario that can serve as training for high-risk professions such as firefighters, soldiers, surgeons, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is AR?</h3>
        <p>	Augmented reality is an enhanced version of the real world, achieved by incorporating digital information into real-life elements via smartphones and AR glasses. AR aims to highlight certain aspects of the real world and derive insights from it.</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <h3>Real-life application of AR</h3>
        
        <p>Augmented reality can change the way we interact with the world. By overlaying information and giving us insights, AR can be used in various applications across multiple industries. Here are some of the industries that AR may affect: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education</strong> - AR can provide interactive and engaging learning experiences. Teachers can present textbook materials with digital concepts to make learning more engaging and interesting.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare</strong> - AR is being used in healthcare for training, diagnosis, and treatment. Surgeons can practice medical procedures via AR simulations, while patients can visualize their medical conditions in 3D.</li>
            <li><strong>Entertainment</strong> - AR has transformed the entertainment industry by creating immersive experiences that combine the real and digital worlds. Popular AR games like Pokémon Go allow players to explore the world while having fun.</li>
            <li><strong>Retail</strong> - Retail uses AR to improve the customer experience. Before making a purchase, customers may virtually try on clothing and see furniture in their homes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality have revolutionized the way we interact with the digital world. While VR immerses us in a separate reality, AR blends virtual concepts into reality. Both technologies have various applications, from entertainment to healthcare.</p>
        <p>As these technologies continue to grow, we can expect applications that will shape how we interact with the world around us!</p>
